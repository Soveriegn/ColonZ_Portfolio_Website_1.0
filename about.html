      My name is Zachary R. Colon — a dedicated and faithful husband of ten years, father of three beautiful children, eldest son of three both paternal and maternal, and United States Army combat veteran based in Brooklyn, New York tranistioning back to Watertown, NY where I served on active duty. 
      My professional career has been a journey in bridging information technology, education, security, fitness, and creative technology. Many of these disciplines seem unrelated but I have found them to work harmonously together in this technological age.
      I have built a life around understanding systems — human, digital, and physical — and connecting them in ways that drive growth, clarity, and impact in meaningful, safe, and sustainable ways.
      Being an active and present father is the foundation of who I am. It shapes how I lead, teach, and build — with purpose, responsibility, and long-term vision at the core of every decision. 
      I don’t just aim to solve problems; I aim to create solutions that last and empower others to thrive. My career sits at the intersection of technology, education, and creativity. From military operations to educational infrastructure, I’ve learned that precision, adaptability, and integrity define success.
      My years in the United States Army as a Combat Engineer specializing in the United States Corp. of Engineer long lasting effective solutions, logistics, and sustainable operations has instilled in me a deep respect for structure and accountability. Supporting combat missions, managing mission-critical resources, and mentoring soldiers taught me the true meaning of leadership — leading people, not just processes. 
      After my service came to a close in 2017, I found purpose in technology and education. When I began attending university to secure a Bachelors of Science in Digtial/Interactive Media and Design. In time I would relocate to Orlando, FL to focus on my second and later third child before eventually looking to gain realworld professional practical expeirence that inforem my education and career trajectory. 
      I began working in the field of ABA where, I advanced through multiple roles, from Behavior Technician to IT Architect, designing secure and accessible systems for diverse learning environments. I focused on building technology that supports neurodivergent students increase the already astounding achievable gains in rdesired bbehavior outcomes and educational gains through solutions that blend reliability with empathy.
      My work has always been human-centered: systems that work for people, not against them. Outside of IT administration, systems design, and network architecture, I’ve spent years as a personal trainer and martial arts instructor, teaching physical discipline and mental resilience. it is my firm beleif that a well maintained Do-Jan can be the most effective foundation to building strong families, deeper intelectual connections, and personal growth,
      That experience strengthened my ability to lead, motivate, and communicate with clarity and patience.  Whether I’m managing a project, mentoring a team, or teaching a class, my approach is rooted in harmony, balance, and strength with empathy, precision with flexibility.
      My current project is to found a Game Development team of likeminded individuals looking to merge technical backgrounds with creative design in an interactive, accessible, open-source, and privacy first ecosystem. I want to create interactive experiences that blend storytelling, mechanics, and meaning. From concept to implementation, I work across Unity, Unreal Engine, Blender,ZBrush, Maya Adobe CC, Affinity, and the endless programming softwares and resources to bring interactive worlds to life. 
      Creative technology, for me, is about more than expression — it’s about connection and purpose with empahsis on purpose as my professional experience has shown me a lack of purposeful deployment of technology, systems, or art. Everything I do — in technology, education, fitness, or creative development — is driven by a simple belief: impact matters.
      I know my worth because it’s built on service, discipline, and a genuine desire to make things better. I don’t just contribute to projects; I elevate them. I bring structure, creativity, and heart to everything I build. I hope this breief  synapsis of who I am and what I stand for gives you a clearer picture of the person behind the portfolio. I always encourage connections, collaborations, and conversations so please enjoy the portfolio and if you wish to contact me please head over to my contat me page.
      I look forward to connecting with you either directly or through my work.
